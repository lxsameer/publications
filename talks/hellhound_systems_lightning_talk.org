* HellHound Systems by <@lxsameer>
** Systems are the most important part of HellHound
** Basically every program should model its execution and data flow and state management using systems.
** Unix pipelines
*** processes are totally seperated and isolated
*** process communicate using stdin and stdout
*** processes are composable
*** processes are reusable
*** Each process does just one thing
** Systems are made from components
*** Components are very similar to unix processes
*** Each component manage its own state
*** Each component has its own input and output streams
*** Components may depends on each other
