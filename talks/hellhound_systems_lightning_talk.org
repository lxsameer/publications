* HellHound Systems
** It's the most important part of HellHound
** Basically every app should model its execution and data flow using systems.
** My main inspriation for systems is Unix pipelines
*** processes are totally seperated
*** process communicate using stdin and stdout
*** processes are composable
*** processes are reusable
** Systems are made from components
** Each component manage its own state
** Each component has its own input and output streams
