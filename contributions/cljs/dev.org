* Clojurescript
** Getting Started
*** Setup environment
- Clone the repo
- cd clojurescript
- run script/bootstrap
- copy clojure.jar into /lib
- script/repl will start a properly-classpathed repl
**** Starting the clojurescript repl
- (require '[cljs.compiler :as comp])
- (def jse (comp/repl-env))
- (comp/repl jse)

** What not to use
*** nREPL
Because people used it in the past and it tend to be the source of some problems.

** Testing
** CLJS tests
fire up a repl by `./scripts/nodejsrepl` then require the namespace in question ( namespace of test for example
cljs.core-test) and use `(cljs.test/test-vars [#'somens/testname])` to run the test
*** Use `lein test` for complation tests and use a REPL for runtime test
** Apply patch to a clone
- Dry run the patch by `git patch --check CLJS-xxxx.patch`
- Apply the patch by `git am < CLJS-xxxx.patch`
