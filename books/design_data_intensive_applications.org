* Chapter 11 - Streams
** Difference between log base messaging and jmt (AMPQ) style maessageing
AMPQ style message consumption is destructive so by consuming a message its gone. but that's not the case for log based messaging
** CDC
It's a process of capturing changes on a data source and notify the downstream node.

In CDC applications won't be aware of CDC.
*** Log compaction and CDC
Log compaction allows CDC to notify nodes only with the recent changes.

*** Databus & wormhole are some example of such software
*** Kafka Connect

** Event Sourcing
Event sourcing is the same as *CDC* but using *immutable* data.

In Event sourcing application *ARE* aware of Event sourcing.
*** Commands and Events
*Commands* are what sent from client to server and *events* produce after validating and processing
commands.

One of important thing to remember is that nodes can not reject events. because by that time another node
might seen that event as well. so stuff like checking for a valid user name and saving it, should either happpen
in two events or the first part should be a validation process before firing the event.
*** Stream checkpoints
*** microbatching
