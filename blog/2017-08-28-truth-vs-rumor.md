TL;DR
> This post is about who to trust 

First of all, This post targets the tech world. Because I’m living in it. But generally it applies everywhere.
About a year ago, one of my friends forwarded a message to me in a social network. It was about benefits of onion for the human skin. I don’t know if onion has any benefit for skin or not. But when I asked about the source of this message, he told me “A doctor sent it to me”. “Do you know him” I said. he told me “No. But he is a doctor”. 
People talk about different matters everyday and everywhere. Including social media, social networks, blogs and basically all over the internet. According to internetlivestats.com, about 40% of the world population have an internet connection today. Imagine this many Internet users are creating content on a daily basis. The internet is a suitable place for people to express their emotion and opinion over different stuff. You can read thousands of tweets everyday which promoting an idea or tool, or sharing the user opinion over a subject. As an Internet user sometime I see people are arguing with each other about something. For example, whether Javascript sucks or not? XBox vs PlayStation, Linux vs Windows, Why to use XYZ as the primary programming language and so many other arguments. When I read an argument or a simple article promoting an idea, many thoughts come to my mind. I think about:
Who wrote this ?
 Is he/she qualified to talk about this subject ? 
What are his/her references ? 
and so on.
There are so many users generating new content every day.
