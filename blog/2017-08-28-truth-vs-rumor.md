TL;DR
> This post is about who to trust 

First of all, This post targets the tech world. Because I’m living in it. But generally it applies everywhere.

About a year ago, one of my friends forwarded a message to me in a social network. It was about benefits of onion
for the human skin. I don’t know if onion has any benefit for skin or not. But when I asked about the source of this message,
he told me “A doctor sent it to me”. “Do you know him” I said. he told me “No. But he is a doctor”.

That made me realize that most of the people around me think of internet as the source of truth. They easily believe something because
they read it somewhere on the Internet. So I decided to prove my hypothesis to myself by running an experiment.

I created a new fake profile on [Telegram](//telegram.org) (Most of my friends and family use it), I claimed to be a astrophysicist and then
posted a message in a crowded group telling people that a huge asteroid is going to crashes into earth.The message started with "BREAKING NEWS: NASA Says ...".

After about two days, people around me sent the same message to me and express their emotion and fear toword that. I was quite surprised by the fact that
the rumor I created got back to me in such a short period of time. I don't know if anyone actually tried to research about the fake news or not, but
lots of people forwarded that message around proves that people believed it.

Lots of companies and individuals use the same strategy to promote their products or increase their income by seducing people to buy their products (
ofcourse I'm not talking about a specific entity).

The same concept applies almost in everywhere. It's hard to read between the lines and find truth in a pile of lies. Sometimes trush is a relative thing.
You might read something that is not entirely true or false.

People talk about different matters everyday and everywhere. Including social media, social networks, blogs and basically all over the internet.
According to [internetlivestats.com](//internetlivestats.com), about 40% of the world population have an internet connection today.
Imagine this many Internet users are creating content on a daily basis. The internet is a suitable place for people to express their emotion and opinion
over different stuff. You can read thousands of tweets everyday which promoting an idea or tool, or sharing the user opinion over a subject. As an Internet user
sometimes I see people are arguing with each other about something. For example, whether Javascript sucks or not? XBox vs PlayStation, Linux vs Windows,
Why to use XYZ as the primary programming language and so many other arguments. When I read an argument or a simple article promoting an idea, many thoughts
come to my mind. I think about:

* Who wrote this?
* Is he/she qualified to talk about this subject?
* What are his/her references?

and so on.

I'v seen so many articles judging about a tool from people who didn't even use it. How should I trust them with their words ? They didn't use the tool
or didn't use it as they should or used a wrong set of metrics for their measurements. Their judgment might be affected by their desire toword some other tool.
I've seen people who claim their tool which they're using is the best tool ever because they are using it and they attached to it and refuse to admit that there
might be a better tool.

## What's the solution then ?
There's no definate solution. But what we can do is to perform some actions before feding something to our minds. Personally if the subject isn't important
I just skip it until it comes up again and again. Then I treat it as an important subject. In case of important subjects a background check on the author
or the source is mandatory. By background check I don't mean to only verify the existance of the person or a valid source, beside existance is
