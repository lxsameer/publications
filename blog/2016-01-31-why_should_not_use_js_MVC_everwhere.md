It's been several years since first **Javascript** MVC framework born and there are
plenty of them fooling around the world. I use many of them including these famous frameworks:

* [AngularJS]()
* [EmberJS]()
* [BackboneJS]()
* [ReactJS]

Last year I struggled with delima of continue using [AngularJS] in a certain project (**Faalis**) or
removing it completely.
