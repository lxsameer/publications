description: I found out the truth about my diet
---

Years ago I was a professional basketball player, playing the point guard. Some day
my foot broke in a match and I stayed at home for about 6 month. I those days I thought
eating more food equal to recovering faster from injury ( Yeah I know I was young ).
Before the injury I was about 73Kg, and after the injury I turned 117Kg ( Wow I knooww).

Long story short afterward I tried really hard to loss weight, but as may most of you
experienced before humans loss weight in diet periods but the lost weight will find its way
back when diet finished.

After 3 years of that incident I started **Kyokushin Karate**, one of the most brutal, heavy and
tough sport possible. Also I was in a diet most of time. I lost weight a lot but as soon as I end
the diet I gain weight again. I always was curious why is that ? I try really hard but as soon as
I ending the diet I gain weight again.

Week ago I found out the truth behind this problem. **Liver** is the most important body part responsible
for storing extra energy of food as fat, and burning fat and produce energy when body needs it.

In this era most when most of us eats fast foods, breath poison instead of air and lots of other reasons,
Most of humans are suffering from a fatty liver in different levels. A fatty liver can't do its job perfectly,
So it can't burn fat correctly, And that's because after a diet people gains weight again. No matter how
hard they try.

Ok, now what's can we do ?

First of all, sport training is very helpful for you liver and help you burn more fat. Second of all
fatty liver have much more fat stored in liver cells and cause huge damage. In order to heal the damaged
cell there are several drugs and medicines which you should take, For example:

* Vitamin E
* Selenium
* Betaine
* Metformin
* Rosiglitazone
* Pioglitazone

Using these medicines you can easily heal you liver cells within a 3 month period. Also there is an other
material which has a really incredible effect. **Silybum marianum** is a kinda rare plant which grows
mostly in dry places.**Silybum marianum** is one the well known rich sources for **milk thistle**.

Research suggests that milk thistle extracts both prevent and repair damage to the liver from toluene
and/or xylene. Workers who had been exposed to vapors from toluene and/or xylene for 5â€“20 years were
given either a standardized milk thistle extract (80% silymarin) or placebo for 30 days.
The workers taking the milk thistle extract showed significant improvement in liver function
tests (ALT and AST) and platelet counts vs. the placebo group.

**LiverGol** is a commercial supplement which contains a great deal of **Silybum marianum**. There isn't
any known side effect for this supplement. I easily healed my liver using this medicine.

I tried to summarize everything and avoid blabbing, So long story short the key to a successful diet is
**to have a healthy liver**.
